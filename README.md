projectEuler
============

To see my old solutions, go to the "old" branch. I am working on teaching myself Haskell by doing every problem from scratch 
on the master branch.


my solutions to project Euler problems


If you don't know what Project Euler is, I suggest you [check it out!](https://projecteuler.net/)


Disclaimer: If you have not done these questions yet, or are working on them currently, don't cheat by looking at my answers! You are only cheating yourself.

This repo is intended for my own organization across computers, and so I can collaborate with friends on some of the questions.

If you think you have a way to improve some of my code, feel free to send me a pull request, but make sure you thoroughly comment your changes. I will not add something to my repo which I do not understand.
